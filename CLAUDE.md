## Engram — 5-Layer Memory System

You have a 5-layer memory system in `.claude/memory/`:

| Layer | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1. Core Identity | `CLAUDE.md` | Permanent rules, always active |
| 2. Lossless | `memory/lossless/` | Raw session transcripts (append-only) |
| 3. Semantic | `memory/semantic/` | Distilled facts, searchable knowledge |
| 4. Procedural | `memory/procedural/` | Workflows, standards, how-tos |
| 5. Active | `memory/active/` | Today's tasks, context, blockers |

**Retrieval priority**: Active → Semantic → Procedural → Lossless

**Session workflow**:
- Start: `engram start "topic"` (or `bash .claude/scripts/engram-start "topic"`)
- Every 30 min: `engram end "summary"` (MANDATORY checkpoint)
- Search: `engram search "query"`

**Update rules**:
- After every 3-4 tool calls: update `active/current-tasks.md`
- After solving a problem: distill learnings → `semantic/`
- After documenting a workflow: write to `procedural/`
- Never delete memory files — supersede or append with dates
